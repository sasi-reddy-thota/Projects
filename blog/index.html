                    <p>Initially, it was a bit difficult to discern whether the screenshot was genuine or an internet meme created to take a dig at the prolific cricketer 
                        and the Lovely Professional University. The fact that there was no timestamp in the tweet featured in the screenshot and nor did the tweet appear 
                        on the cricketer’s official Twitter account only added to suspicions that the post might be photoshopped.
                        But to everyone’s surprise, the post was authentic and was shared by Virat Kohli himself on his Instagram account. In his post on Instagram,
                        Kohli said, “India needs 10 more LPUs. Best of luck to the 11 LPU students who are representing India at the 2021 Tokyo Olympics. Truly a great
                        achievement!” Along with the message, Kohli shared three pictures, one of them being the screenshot that went viral
                        and the other two being about the Lovely Professional University and the 11 athletes from the LPU that were part of India’s Olympics contingent.

                        The most crucial and optimal stage of your career would be the final year of your graduation and the one following that. Every 
                        student dreams to get placed in renowned companies from college/University itself.Actually Salary package depends on factors 
                        like specialization, Institute, Company offering job, students academic performance, work experience etc. As a general rule for placements, a lot more will depend upon your own hard work, communication & presentation skills and overall preparation. This would be true for any university you enroll in. Also, in my view, I think you should not worry about the placements. If you work hard in the course and learn as much as you can, any company visiting the campus would be happy to hire you. However, you must not neglect polishing your communication skills as well, because companies will check that in their interviews. LPU provides plenty of opportunities to its students to take part in events, competitions, fests in order to let them grow their personality and give them a chance to polish their skills. Now,Being a alumni of LPU I would like share my experience in Lovely Professional university. LPU provides ample opportunities to each and every of the eligible students to secure good placement.Apart from that, internships as well as capstone projects are an integral part of curriculum which are very vital for getting placement. A lot of students have successfully started their own ventures as entrepreneurs. The university has its own start up school which promotes start up’s in collaboration with startup India program. University prepares its students for placements through special inputs in the form of placement classes from first year onward, it may be Soft-Skills, G.D, presentation’s, Extempore’s, Technical Interview’s, Personal Interview’s...to make the student’s to crack their dream companies Around 550+ companies visit every year for such activities and campus-recruitment of students from LPU. And this year for batch graduating in 2020, already more than 650 placement/internship drives have been conducted till February 2020 with leading industry giants (more than 90% being MNCs). Lovely Professional University provides placement opportunities to all the deserving candidates, from all courses. It's up to the student's capability to be able to grab the opportunity or not. Till now thousand of students are placed at a very good package all around the world. Some of the alumni are working in the top 10 brands in the world. Recently,Tania Arora, a fourth-year BTech CSE student of Lovely Professional University (LPU) got selected as a software engineer in Microsoft with a huge salary package of Rs 42 lakh per annum.A final year student of MSC. Agriculture (Agronomy) has bagged a package of Rs. 1 crore. The package has been offered by Monsanto, an agrochemical company and now part of the crop sciences. This student has been offered the role of production manager at MonsantoNSE 0.13 % Canada, according to the institute. Lovely Professional University Placement Highlights: Recently 13 students got placed in Amazon with 30 LPA. Three students of Computer science batch has been placed in Amazon for a salary package of 28 LPA and 28 students have been selected as an intern who could be converted into a full-time employee after their internship. VMware has selected nine students from B.Tech IT/CS for a salary package of 9 LPA. Nearly 50 top tier companies, and overall more than 500 companiess are visiting the LPU campus for recruitment. The alumni of LPU are now working in Google and Yahoo for a salary package of 1Cr/ annum. LPU has conducted more than 200 campus drives out of which more than 100 drives were for technology & science students. LPU has created a record of placing 610 students in a single day on campus. LPU also guides its students to take entrepreneurship as a career. Well-known startups like Practo & Think and Learn has selected 60 students from LPU for a salary package of 5-10 LPA. You can see that the university puts in every effort to bring the best companies for campus recruitment, but it is only up to the student to make the most of these opportunities. Honestly, it is all about making the best use of resources around and from concept building to placement training to campus placements, there is nothing that the college does not offer. Now, it is up to you to get the best out of it! So, definitely, in my view, LPU will be a good choice for placements. All the best for your future. Thank You!
